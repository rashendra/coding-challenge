# Employee Hierarchy   API

### How To Build and Run the API

Pre-requisites
--------------
JDK 1.8.x 

Technologies/ Libraries used

    Java 8

    Sprin Rest Web Services 
    Mockito
    AssertJ
    Angularjs 1.X
    Gradle wrapper 

#### How to run and deploy
Go to the project root directory and run following commands
###### To build the application
    ./gradlew build    or just gradle build
    
###### To Run the application    
    ./gradlew bootRun or just gradle bootRun
##Once deployed the web application can be accessed using the below url 
## http://localhost:8080/


## Access the API
Please use one of the below tools to access the application 
  1. Postman either stand alone or Ext to chrome 
  2. SOAP UI 

##Useful information , data structures 
 ### The main data structure which has been exercise in this project is Stack. For this I have use the java recursion has been used as the stack to traverse the elements to form the tree structure. However 
 	 we could define a separate stack data structure to handle this
 ### All the post requests will be authenticated against an api key. Please see below for further details. All the post requests will be filtered through HttpMethodAuthorisationFilter.java
 ### Rest-assured has been used to test the web services
 ### Mockito with JUnit has been used for the TDD approach  
 ### Spring Rest web services has been used to develop  Rest-ful api for the application.
 ### Have used an in memory data base , just to keep the project simple. Can modify this application to work with spring repository by extending  JpaRepository<Entity,Long>
 ### Please click the pre-loaded employee button if you need to have a quick demonstration

## The current organization should have only one CEO (allowing one record to be set without a manager id)
## All other employees should have a valid manager id ( Should be one of the employee as his manager)
## Employee name is mandatory when adding employees   
    
# Further enhancement and limitations 
## Use Karma test cases in the front end
## Replace the in memory database with RDMS such as mysql, postgres
## Use JpaRepository or spring CrudRepository which will build the ORM support - Can use RDS instance hosted in AWS
